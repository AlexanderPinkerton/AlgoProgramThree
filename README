Compiler Used: IntelliJ

Program Description:
    This program will allow the input of console commands to manipulate a graph.
    The program has all typical graph functionality for traversing and analyzing.
    The graph class uses generics to allow for easier reuse and includes
    Djikstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path as well as a BFS based search to find
    all reachable vertices.

File Breakdown:
    Graph.java contains all code needed to construct a graph including two inner classes, Edge and Vertex.
    Main.java is the Driver class to allow for console commands.
    PriorityQ.java is a custom priority queue implemented in a heap for use in Djikstra's algo.

Data Structures:
    I created a graph using generics so I would be able to use it in future projects.
    The shortest path method uses a queue, as it is required for the algorithm.


Everything should be working as intended.
